Users can click and drag the 3D interactive globe and click on a continent to display its top three most endangered species as well as species-specific charity links. Charities were 
verified for legitimacy and impact using [Charity Navigator](https://www.charitynavigator.org/)

The Species List tab displays the information for all species as well as their associated charity links and continents.

WildWatch is currently a frontend-only application built with React. The interactive globe was created using the D3.js library.
